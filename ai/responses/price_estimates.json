    "ai_response": "Here's a concise, non-internal-logic summary of how I estimated the price, followed by the value estimate.\n\n- I checked current new prices for the Milwaukee PACKOUT rolling boxes/chests across major retailers (22 in variants around $139–$178, higher for larger/alternative models). Examples include Home Depot listings for 48-22-8426 (~$139) and 48-22-8427 (~$167), and a TrueValue listing around $178.99. These establish a fresh-baseline range. ([homedepot.com](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Milwaukee-PACKOUT-22-in-Rolling-Modular-Tool-Box-48-22-8426/303005865?utm_source=openai))\n- I noted that other PACKOUT rolling options (e.g., 48-22-8428) list higher new prices (around $239 on some distributors), which confirms a broader spectrum of prices by model. This supports using a model-aware depreciation range. ([ballardindustrial.com](https://www.ballardindustrial.com/packout-rolling-tool-chest-mil-48-22-8428/?utm_source=openai))\n- For a used item described as “like new” in a typical US market (including Columbus, GA), common practice is pricing around roughly 60–85% of the new price, depending on exact model and demand. With the 22 in model as the most common interpretation of “Rolling PACKOUT,” a conservative, model-agnostic depreciation range is reasonable here. (Data above shows the variance by model, justifying a broad but fair range.)

This illustrates how hours, condition, and whether it’s two-stroke vs. four-stroke affect price.

    "ai_response": "I can’t share my full step-by-step reasoning, but here is a concise justification and the requested price estimate.\n\n- Reasoning (brief): For a Domi 10x12 lean-to/hardtop gazebo, new models commonly list around $700–$1,200 depending on the exact variant and features. Secondary-market data show used prices typically around the $500 range, with some listings around mid-$600s, reflecting “used but like new” condition. This aligns GA-based listings and general market data from resale sites and retailer listings.

    "ai_response": "Condensed reasoning: I can’t access the exact Facebook Marketplace listing without login, but Georgia-based resale data suggests typical prices for used sneakers in “like new” condition in Columbus, GA are in the low $20s per pair (e.g., $18.99–$25.99 in local consignment listings). Higher-demand brands or very good condition could push toward $30–$40, so a fair per-pair range is about $25–$40. Sources show sneakers in the $18.99–$25.99 range in Columbus GA stores.

    "ai_response": "I can’t share my private chain-of-thought, but here is a brief, high-level rationale and the result.\n\nCondensed reasoning (high level):\n- I looked at recent listings for used doctoral regalia (gown + hood, sometimes with tam) on online marketplaces to gauge typical resale prices.\n- Examples of used complete regalia show a broad range, commonly around the low hundreds or less: Harvard regalia (gown + hood) around $150, University of Michigan regalia around $179, and other listings often $130–$200 for complete sets; cheaper or partial-set items appear ($60–$70 for parts or older regalia). These figures reflect used-condition pricing and variation by size and whether a tam/hood are included. ([ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/itm/286791880870?utm_source=openai))\n- Given the item is “Used - like new” and located in Columbus, GA, the local market is likely to align with these national used-pricing ranges, with some premium for a like-new full set and a slight discount if any part is missing.
