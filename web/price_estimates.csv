Notes:
- If the set is a newer Callaway complete set with a bag and all irons, woods, and a putter, expect toward the upper end (closer to $500–$600) depending on exact model and shaft specs.
- If the bag is older or the set includes more scratches or wear, expect closer to the lower end (around $300–$400).
- Local demand on Facebook Marketplace can shift pricing by a small amount; ensure you show clear photos, confirm shaft flex, grip condition, and that all clubs are included in the set.

Fair market value estimate:
- Item details: Five fixed-weight dumbbell sets (30, 40, 50, 60, 80 lbs) with individual asking prices totaling $60, $80, $130, $150, $180, plus $545 for all five.
- Total weight: 260 lbs.
- Reasonable used price per pound for older fixed-dumbbell sets in many U.S. markets: roughly $0.80–$1.20 per lb (occasionally higher for very good condition, but SF-area listings often skew toward mid-range).
- Estimated fair market value range: 260 lbs × ($0.80 to $1.20) ≈ $208 to $312.
- Given the bundled asking price is $545 (about $2.10 per lb) which is above typical used-market ranges, a fair market value would align closer to the mid-to-lower end of typical used pricing.
